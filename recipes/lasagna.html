    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>Step 1:Prepare the Meat Sauce:</h3>
                <p>In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium-high heat until browned and crumbled.</p>
                <p>Add chopped onions and minced garlic, cooking until onions are translucent and fragrant.</p>
                <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, water, sugar, basil, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper.</p>
                <p>Simmer uncovered for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in chopped parsley towards the end. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>
            <h3>Step 2:Prepare the Cheese Filling:</h3>
                <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, salt, dried parsley, and dried basil. Mix until smooth and well blended. Set aside.</p>
            <h3>Step 3:Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</h3>
                <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</p>
                <p>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente.</p>
                <p>Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking. Set aside.</p>
            <h3>Step 4:Assemble the Lasagna:</h3>
                <p>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</p>
                <p>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
                <p>Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping.</p>
                <p>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</p>
                <p>Sprinkle with a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese.</p>
                <p>Repeat layers: meat sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, and cheeses.</p>
                <p>Finish with a final layer of noodles topped with remaining meat sauce and cheeses.</p>
            <h3>Step 5: Bake the Lasagna:</h3>
                <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, tenting slightly to prevent cheese from sticking.</p>
                <p>Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.</p>
                <p>Remove foil and bake uncovered for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until hot and bubbly and cheese is melted and golden brown on top.</p>
            <h3>Step 6:Let it Rest and Serve:</h3>
                <p>Remove from oven and let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing.</p>
                <p>Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.</p>
